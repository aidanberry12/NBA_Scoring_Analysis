# NBA_Scoring_Analysis

## Introduction

Sports analytics is a growing industry, as team owners, coaches, and analysts are starting to recognize the value that data-driven analyses can provide. When used correctly, this information can optimize the team's performance and give them insights into previously untapped areas of the game. This knowledge can be useful to players, coaches, and administration staff to make better decisions on behalf of the team. When data is properly utilized to gather a deeper understanding of the game, the level at which basketball is played and enjoyed can both be improved.

In my analyses, I used NBA player data combined with season statistics data to predict the number of points a given player would predict throughout an upcoming season.

## Data Description

I used datasets found on Kaggle.com and data.world for this analysis. The datasets contained information about players from the National Basketball Association (NBA). The different datasets used in the analysis are as follows:

* Season Stats: 24,700 observations of aggregate season statistics for every player and season since 1950
* Player Data: 5,000 observations of nominal data about each player since 1950, including the specific years spent in the NBA, college attended, height, and weight
* NBA All Star Data: A collection of 440 players selected to the NBA All-Star Game every year from 2000-2016; includes nominal information such as draft status, team, and nationality
